# Binary Heap in Java language!


This is an Binary Heap repository. This is pretty much straight forward.

You can find the file in the "src" directory, named has "MaxPQ". I added some notes to the Main class about this Object.

Thank you for reading!

To do:
* Add security (don't let the user add more than the Heap can take, since the size is fixed).
* or I can change the code to make the Heap with mutable size (probably using nodes).
* Add new functions to the code:
    * Remove some specific position in the Heap
    * Pass an array and add to the heap the contents of that array
    * Pass an array to a new initializer, this way the Heap can start with a lot of values
    * Maybe write something that will create an image to see clearer the contents of the array (probably some PDF)
